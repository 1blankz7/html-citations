  Abstract                 = {A large number of vision applications rely on matching keypoints across images. The last decade featured an arms-race towards faster and more robust keypoints and association algorithms: Scale Invariant Feature Transform ({SIFT)}, Speed-up Robust Feature ({SURF)}, and more recently Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints ({BRISK)} to name a few. These days, the deployment of vision algorithms on smart phones and embedded devices with low memory and computation complexity has even upped the ante: the goal is to make descriptors faster to compute, more compact while remaining robust to scale, rotation and noise. To best address the current requirements, we propose a novel keypoint descriptor inspired by the human visual system and more precisely the retina, coined Fast Retina Keypoint ({FREAK).} A cascade of binary strings is computed by efficiently comparing image intensities over a retinal sampling pattern. Our experiments show that {FREAKs} are in general faster to compute with lower memory load and also more robust than {SIFT}, {SURF} or {BRISK.} They are thus competitive alternatives to existing keypoints in particular for embedded applications.},
